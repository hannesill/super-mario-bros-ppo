# Super Mario Bros PPO

This project is an exploration into deep reinforcement learning using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on OpenAI's Super Mario Bros Gym. The goal is to train an agent to play the classic game of Super Mario Bros by leveraging a customized PPO algorithm, along with various environment wrappers for preprocessing and reward shaping.

The template file was provided by my university course "Applied Cognitive Computing: Deep reinforcement learning with bounded rationality".

## Setup

Copy-paste the code into Google Colab.

## Usage

Run the colab file.
